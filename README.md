## Usage Instructions:
1. Place the model files from the `checkpoints` folder into the corresponding directory in the main project.
2. Move the `android_demo` folder and its contents into the `demos` directory.
   *(Note: The files can be placed elsewhere as long as you configure the paths correctly.)*

For further details, please refer to the main project [android_dune_seg](https://github.com/warmrid233/android_dune_seg) (link above).

### Key Notes:
- **Flexible Paths**: The `android_demo` files can be placed in any location if you properly configure the runtime paths.
- **Model Setup**: Ensure the checkpoint models are correctly placed in the main project's structure.
